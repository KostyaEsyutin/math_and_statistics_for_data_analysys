# Math and Statistics for Data Analysis
*Hi!* <br>
*I'm Konstantin or just Konsta, <br>
I'm Data Analyst working in a large bank in Eastern Europe, and, honestly, I often need a math/statistical fundamentals recap*

This repository contains small, self-contained experiments in applied mathematics and statistics to help me, first of all

The goal is not performance or production-ready code, but:
- understanding core concepts from first principles
- making assumptions explicit
- connecting mathematical theory with data analysis practice

## Topics (work in progress)
- Matrix/vector operations
- Linear regression (OLS) from scratch

## Status
Work in progress. The repository evolves as new topics are explored.
